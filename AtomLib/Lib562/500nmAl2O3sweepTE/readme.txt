The simulation model in this filder:
lattice constant = 562nm to creat normal ouput
H_Al2O3 = 500nm
H_atom from 500nm to 1490nm 10nm gap
R_atom from 30nm to 250nm 2nm gap
Input plane wave is s-wave(TE)
Lib562sweep_E.txt and Lib562sweep_T.txt are the original results from S4.
SweepPhase562.txt is the wrapped and normalized phase.
Enew.txt is the E-field data from S4 without parentheses.
(i,j) in the txt files represents radius=30+2*j nm and height=500+10*j nm i,j start from 0
