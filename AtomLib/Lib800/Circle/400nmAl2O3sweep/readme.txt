The simulation model in this filder:
lattice constant = 800nm
H_Al2O3 = 400nm
H_atom from 500nm to 1490nm
R_atom from 100nm to 300nm
Input plane wave is p-wave(TM)
atomLib800sweep_E.txt and atomLib800sweep_T.txt are the original results from S4.
SweepPhase800.txt is the wrappe and normalized phase.
(i,j) in the txt files represents radius=100+j nm and height=500+10*j nm i,j start from 0
