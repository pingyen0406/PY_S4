The simulation model in this filder:
lattice constant = 800nm
H_Al2O3 = 500nm
Half major/minor axis from 100nm to 300nm 2nm gap
H_atom = 800nm
Input plane wave is s-wave(TE)
Ellipse800sweep_E.txt and Ellipse800sweep_T.txt are the original results from S4.
SweepPhase800.txt is the wrappe and normalized phase.
(i,j) in the txt files represents half minor axis=100+2j nm
and half major axis =500+10*j nm i,j start from 0
